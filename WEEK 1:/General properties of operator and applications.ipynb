    " We can interpret the action of XOR in a number of different ways, and this helps to shed light on its properties.\n",
    " \n",
    " The most obvious way to interpret it is as its name suggests, ‘exclusive OR’: A ^ B is true if and only if precisely one of A and B is true. Another way to think of it is as identifying difference in a pair of bytes: A ^ B = ‘the bits where they differ’.**This interpretation makes it obvious that A ^ A = 0 (byte A does not differ from itself in any bit) and A ^ 0 = A (byte A differs from 0 precisely in the bit positions that equal 1) and is also useful when thinking about toggling and encryption later on.**\n",
    " \n",
    "Encryption example could be something like a  file:\n",
    "\n",
    "a=123454passcode:1223\n",
    "\n",
    "b=123454\n",
    "\n",
    "as a^b will give you back the passcode value to the another user who known the mask value like b.\n",

    "The last, and most powerful, interpretation of XOR is in terms of parity , i.e. whether something is odd or even. \n",

    "**Important interpretation**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "eg:1011(11)\n",
    "\n",

    "Now we will see the first application of XOR with respect to parity . There are many ways to defend against data corruption when sending digital information. One of the simplest is to use XOR to combine all the bits together into a single parity bit which gets appended to the end of the message. By comparing the received parity bit with the calculated one, we can reliably determine when a single bit has been corrupted (or indeed any odd number of bits). But if 2 bits have been corrupted (or indeed any even number of bits) this check will not help us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checksums and cyclic redundancy checks (CRC) extend the concept to longer check values and reducing the likelihood of collisions and are widely used. It’s important to note that such checks are error-detecting but not error-correcting : we can tell that an error has occurred, but we don’t know where it occurred and so can’t recover the original message. Examples of error-correcting codes that also rely on XOR are BCH and Reed-Solomon  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic). "
